**JobListing Application**

This repository contains a full-stack web application named JobListing, which is designed to allow users to search for job listings based on specific keywords. The backend of the application is built using Java Spring Boot, and the frontend is developed using React.js. The application uses MongoDB Atlas (MongoDB Cloud) as the database, enabling robust and scalable data storage and retrieval.

**Features**

Job Listing Management: Create, read.

Keyword-Based Search: Users can search for jobs using specific keywords, with advanced search capabilities powered by MongoDB's aggregation pipeline.
MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline: Apply complex queries to filter job listings based on various criteria such as job title, company, location, and more.
Responsive Frontend: User-friendly and responsive interface built with React.js.
Scalable Backend: Spring Boot backend API with RESTful endpoints for managing job listings and user interactions.

**Technologies Used:**
1. **Backend:**

    Java Spring Boot: For building the RESTful API   and business logic.
    MongoDB Atlas: Cloud-based NoSQL database for   storing job listings and user data.
    Spring Data MongoDB: Integration with MongoDB to  handle data persistence.
    Spring Boot Security: For securing API endpoints and managing user authentication.

**Frontend**:

1. React.js: For building the user interface and managing frontend state.
Axios: For making HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend API.
React Router: For handling routing and navigation within the application.

**Getting Started**
**Prerequisites**: 
To run this project locally, you need to have the following installed:

Java 17 or later
Node.js (with npm or yarn)
MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB instance)

**Backend Setup**
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/joblisting.git
    cd joblisting/backend
    ```

2. **Set up MongoDB Atlas**:
   - Create a MongoDB Atlas account and set up a cluster.
   - Update the `application.properties` file with your MongoDB URI:
   
    ```properties
    spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
    ```

3. **Build and run the Spring Boot application**:
    ```bash
    ./mvnw clean install
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the React development server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

Access the application:

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000.

MongoDB Aggregation Examples

The application leverages MongoDB's aggregation framework to perform advanced searches. Below are some examples of how aggregation pipelines are used in the application:

Text Search: Search for job listings by matching keywords in job titles or descriptions.
Filter by Location: Filter jobs based on location.
