**JobListing Application**

This repository contains a full-stack web application named JobListing, which is designed to allow users to search for job listings based on specific keywords. The backend of the application is built using Java Spring Boot, and the frontend is developed using React.js. The application uses MongoDB Atlas (MongoDB Cloud) as the database, enabling robust and scalable data storage and retrieval.

**Features**

Job Listing Management: Create, read.

Keyword-Based Search: Users can search for jobs using specific keywords, with advanced search capabilities powered by MongoDB's aggregation pipeline.
MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline: Apply complex queries to filter job listings based on various criteria such as job title, company, location, and more.
Responsive Frontend: User-friendly and responsive interface built with React.js.
Scalable Backend: Spring Boot backend API with RESTful endpoints for managing job listings and user interactions.

**Technologies Used:**
1. **Backend:**

    1. Java Spring Boot: For building the RESTful API   and business logic.
    2. MongoDB Atlas: Cloud-based NoSQL database for   storing job listings and user data.
    3. Spring Data MongoDB: Integration with MongoDB to  handle data persistence.
    
2. **Frontend**:

    1. React.js: For building the user interface and managing frontend state.
    2. Axios: For making HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend API.
    3. React Router: For handling routing and navigation within the application.

**Getting Started**
**Prerequisites**: 
To run this project locally, you need to have the following installed:

Java 17 or later
Node.js (with npm or yarn)
MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB instance)

**Backend Setup**
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/joblisting.git
    cd joblisting/backend
    ```

2. **Set up MongoDB Atlas**:
   - Create a MongoDB Atlas account and set up a cluster.
   - Update the `application.properties` file with your MongoDB URI:
   
    ```properties
    spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
    ```

3. **Build and run the Spring Boot application**:
    ```bash
    ./mvnw clean install
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```

### Frontend Setup
1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the React development server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

Access the application:

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000.

MongoDB Aggregation Examples

The application leverages MongoDB's aggregation framework to perform advanced searches. Below are some examples of how aggregation pipelines are used in the application:

Text Search: Search for job listings by matching keywords in job titles or descriptions.
Filter by Location: Filter jobs based on location.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
